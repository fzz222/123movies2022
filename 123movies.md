**What is 123movies**

The world's most famous pirated video site was created in 2015 in Vietnam. Its developers were students from the University of Medicine and Pharmacy in Cantho. On the pages of the resource https://www.123-movies.im/ you can find and watch online the latest movies, everyone's favorite movies, to which the rights holders have closed free access. Each month the site is visited by almost 98 million people. Such popularity did not like the owners of the rights to the film. A hunt for the developers began, providers began to block 123movies. The portal repeatedly changed its Internet address until 2018. Just a couple of months later, after it was recognized in the U.S. as the largest pirate site in the world, the owners were forced to close the project. Later, numerous copies of the site began to appear, which are very similar to the original version in design and navigation...
